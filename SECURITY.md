## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, **do not** create a public issue.

Instead, please report it via email:

In your report, please include:

- A detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue (proof-of-concept code if possible)
- The potential impact

We will investigate all legitimate reports and respond as quickly as possible. Responsible disclosure is greatly appreciated.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

- Avoid exploiting the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it.
- Do not use vulnerabilities to access or modify data that does not belong to you.
